## *Force Feasible Set prediction with artificial neural network and musculoskeletal model*

Use tensorflow-gpu 1.1.0

In this repository, you can fin: 

    - A sample of the dataset used in this study
    - 5 differents Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
    - A python script (Main.py)
    
Main.py include everything necessary to load the different ANN, test the dataset and plot the predicted values in function of the true values.
